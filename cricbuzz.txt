{"commentary": [{"comm": "Delhi v Hyderabad, Match 11- Preview", "over": null}, {"comm": "<b>Preview</b> by <b>Ganesh Chandrasekaran </b><br/><br/>With back-to-back defeats and wins kickstarting the season for Sunrisers Hyderabad and Delhi Capitals respectively, the clash on Tuesday at least sees a favourite based on recent form.<br/><br/>And as the results dictate, questions are abound around SRH more than the ones against DC. What has gone wrong? How can it be changed around? Is Kane Williamson, who declared himself fit and available, the answer for SRH's troubles or will his presence affect their team balance?<br/><br/>These questions get exacerbated when you bring the conditions into the equation. For teams like to factor in these things and bring in the right horses for the courses, but the choice even there isn't straightforward. Is batting first still the right choice? Remember David Warner was the first captain to choose to do so after winning the toss, and ended up on the losing side on the very ground they play Delhi. It's fair to say that no team has as yet got a grip over the conditions in the early stages of IPL 2020, and the dew factor has played a big part in these plans going awry. Senior voices in the thinktanks across the teams have confessed to being stumped by what to expect exactly with respect to dew.<br/><br/>The problems thus leave one team with a far more settled eleven getting into the match, while the other searches to find their best groove. The one advantage they could still hold in this context of the conditions is that they already know what Abu Dhabi holds, while their opponent is yet to play a game here.<br/><br/><b>When:</b> September 29, Tuesday at 19:30 IST<br/><br/><b>Where:</b> Sheikh Zayed Stadium, Abu Dhabi<br/><br/><b>What to expect:</b> That's the million dollar question, isn't it? All teams continue to play a guessing game. You can definitely expect the captain winning the toss to be under some pressure to make a decision.<br/><br/><b>Team News:</b><br/><br/><b>Delhi Capitals</b> There is unlikely to be too many changes to a winning combination. But every day they wait on the fitness results of two of their first-choice players - R Ashwin and Ishant Sharma. The duo has started bowling in the practice sessions already, But based on the performances of the bowlers, DC will be hard pressed to bring in the pacer back sooner than Ashwin, whose replacement Amit Mishra had a good outing in the previous game.<br/><br/><b>Probable XI:</b> Shikhar Dhawan, Prithvi Shaw, Shreyas Iyer, Rishabh Pant, Shimron Hetmyer, Marcus Stoinis, Axar Patel, Kagiso Rabada, Anrich Nortje, Amit Mishra, Ishant Sharma<br/><br/><b>Sunrisers Hyderabad</b> After their first loss, SRH tinkered with the line-up aplenty making as many as three changes, with only one forced due to injury. How many more will they make after a second loss? There is room for experimentation and questions particularly in one middle order slot and one fast bowling slot. The contenders are plenty as well, but will SRH bite the bullet once again?<br/><br/><b>Probable XI:</b> David Warner, Jonny Bairstow, Manish Pandey, Kane Williamson/Mohammad Nabi, Wriddhiman Saha, Priyam Garg, Abhishek Sharma, Rashid Khan, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Siddharth Kaul/Basil Thampi, T Natarajan<br/><br/><b>Did you know</b><br/><br/>- SRH are on a five-match losing streak, their longest such streak in IPL<br/><br/>- Rishabh Pant has a strike-rate of 250 against Bhuvneshwar Kumar and has been dismissed only once by the latter in IPL<br/><br/>- In Abu Dhabi, between overs 7 and 15, teams have lost wicket less frequently and average higher than the other periods<br/><br/><b>What they said:</b><br/><br/>\"If a player is getting overconfident, Ricky would remind them to not be so and if a player is low, Ponting would make sure he boosts them up and he knows exactly what to say. The best thing about him is he is a positive speaker, never heard him saying a single negative thing.
